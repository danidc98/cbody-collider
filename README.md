# cbody-collider
This is my end of degree project of Electronic Engineering: A 3D animated celestial body collider which implements the Barnes-Hut algorithm

Download the zip and just execute from a directory inside the project:

mvn clean javafx:run


It will appear a window with the application. Try it :)
if your computer can't handle the calculations, try increasing the Barnes-Hut parameter and you will see the true power of this application!
If you have doubts or some interest, you can ask me :)
